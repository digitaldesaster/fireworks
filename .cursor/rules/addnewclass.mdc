IF you need to add new classes then:

- Add the class in [db_document.py](mdc:core/db_document.py)
    - you can use the Example class to see which fields are available
    - please ask the user which fields he needs if unclear
    - you also need to add the class details to the getDefaults function in the db_document.py

- Add a link to the new class in the [nav.html](mdc:templates/main/nav.html)
    - ask the user if hew wants to add it to the admin sections or to the gloabl section.
    - choose a icon for the new class
    - use the exact same patterns like already in the nav.html to have the exact styling. 

- Restart Server
    - tell the user to restart the apache2 server
        - sudo systemctl restart apache2
